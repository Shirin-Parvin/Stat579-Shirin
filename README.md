My first github repo

- List item 1
- List item 2

Name: Shirin

In the past month the three main activity I have been doing are:
- Conducting summer research
- Cooking
- Cycling/ Biking

I usually work on optical sensor data, which is nothing but wavelength data.

Three of the most important tool/ strategy I use to analyze data are:
- MS Excel to plot the data and visualise the trend
- C# code to capture the data as a csv file
